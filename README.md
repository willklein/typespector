# Typespector README

> Inspect and explore your TypeScript types

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Roadmap

I need this to give me a way to view a type, and any of types it's composed of. And for each of those types, I want to go down the tree of types as far as I want... and I want to know the path I took to get there.

I don't want all of these tyeps to be across different lines or files; I want them to be in a single interface - not just a view, but something I can interface and interact _with._

The goal is to take any type in TypeScript and make it something I can understand more readily.

Static Display

- [-] Display type info in a panel
  - [x] quick

Type History

- [ ] manage a history of inspected types for later reference

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
- `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

- Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
- Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
- Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
